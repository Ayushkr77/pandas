Pandas: 
Pandas is a Python library for data analysis and manipulation.
It is built on top of NumPy and makes working with structured data (like tables, spreadsheets, databases) much easier.

Key Features of Pandas:
Provides two main data structures:
    Series → 1D labeled array (like a column in Excel).
    DataFrame → 2D labeled table (like an Excel sheet or SQL table).
Handles missing data easily.
Supports data cleaning, filtering, grouping, merging, reshaping, and aggregation.
Can read/write data from many formats: CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, etc.
Built for data analysis and often used in data science & machine learning.



Why Pandas?
Works like Excel in Python but with much more power.
Simplifies data manipulation that would take many lines of code with plain Python or NumPy.
Essential for data science, machine learning, finance, research, and analytics.

In short:
NumPy = fast number crunching.
Pandas = powerful data manipulation (especially tabular data).
